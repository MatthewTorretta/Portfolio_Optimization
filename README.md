# Portfolio_Optimization
Calculating expected annual returns and optimal portfolios using python. 

In the estimation of the parameters of an optimal portfolio, the historical inputs will make a big difference in the results. Given that
druing Feb-March 2020 there has been an ongoing financial crisis related to the
COVID-19 disease, I am going to analyse two models for the input of historical data:

Dow Jones Industrial, S&P500, FTSE100, EZU, and Gold prices.

From [ 27-Jan-2020 to 23-March-2020 ] and from the 5 years between [ January 2015 until December 2019 ].
